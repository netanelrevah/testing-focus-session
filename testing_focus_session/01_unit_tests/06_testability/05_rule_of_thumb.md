My rules of thumb
================

- **Class** is a **Role**
    - Examples: Manager, Runner, Factory, Task
- **Function** is an **Action**
    - Examples: manager, run, create, execute
- **Variable/Property** is **Value**
    - Examples: manager_cls, runner_instance, result, counter

- If you need to monkeypatch it. do **refactor**!
